Type: architecture
======================================================================

Technical architecture diagram for: 

Diagram showing: Data engineering pipeline/architecture
Components to visualize:
- Data sources (left side): Databases, APIs, streaming data
- Ingestion layer: Data connectors, ETL/ELT tools
- Storage layer: Data warehouse, data lake (Snowflake, Databricks, cloud storage)
- Processing layer: Data transformation, compute engines
- Output layer (right side): BI tools, analytics, ML models

Style: Modern technical diagram
Visual elements:
- Component boxes with icons
- Arrows showing data flow (left to right)
- Clean, minimalist design
- Color-coded layers (blue for storage, green for processing, etc.)

Colors: Blue/teal primary, with accent colors
Background: White or light gray for clarity
Layout: Horizontal flow chart style, organized layers
Icons: Use simple, recognizable tech/data icons

Key technologies: snowflake, fivetran

Format: 16:9 aspect ratio, professional technical documentation style
Clarity: Labels for each component, easy to understand
