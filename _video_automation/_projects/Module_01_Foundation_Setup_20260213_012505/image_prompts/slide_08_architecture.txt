Slide 8: Module 01 Deliverables
Type: architecture
======================================================================

Technical architecture diagram for: Module 01 Deliverables

Diagram showing: Data engineering pipeline/architecture
Components to visualize:
- Data sources (left side): Databases, APIs, streaming data
- Ingestion layer: Data connectors, ETL/ELT tools
- Storage layer: Data warehouse, data lake (Snowflake, Databricks, cloud storage)
- Processing layer: Data transformation, compute engines
- Output layer (right side): BI tools, analytics, ML models

Style: Modern technical diagram, warm educational aesthetic
Visual elements:
- Component boxes with icons
- Arrows showing data flow (left to right)
- Clean, minimalist design
- Color-coded layers (forest green #2D5F3F for storage, sage green #6B9080 for processing, terracotta #C97D60 for output)

Colors: Forest green (#2D5F3F) and sage green (#6B9080) primary, terracotta (#C97D60) accents
Background: Soft cream/beige (#FDF8F3) for clarity
Layout: Horizontal flow chart style, organized layers
Icons: Use simple, recognizable tech/data icons in green tones

Key technologies: cloud data platforms

Format: 16:9 aspect ratio, professional warm educational style
Clarity: Labels for each component, easy to understand

Key Points to Visualize:
1. 4 databases with clear multi-layer architecture
2. 4 warehouses with auto-suspend and resource monitors
3. 5 functional roles with least-privilege and future grants
4. Production-ready foundation for metadata-driven ingestion
